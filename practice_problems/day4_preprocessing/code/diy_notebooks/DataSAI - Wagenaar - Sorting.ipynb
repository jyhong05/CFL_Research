Let's try to figure out what we have in terms of action potentials. Extracting action potentials from multielectrode voltage traces, and assigning them to specific neurons, has long been more art than science. One reason is that ground truth is generally not available, so quantifying whether one algorithm performs better than another has been difficult. Also, traditionally, different spike sorters have required input data in slightly different formats, and presented their results in different formats. Format conversion is not hard, but unpleasant enough that unbiased and quantitative comparison has been rare. And spike sorting is a slow process, so running lots of spike sorters on your data requires a real commitment of time.\n","\n","Faster computers and the publication of a generalized interface to spike sorting have improved the situation recently. In this exercise, you will feed a section of our data into one modern spike sorter, then compare your results with other students who used different sorters."],"metadata":{"id":"RJ61TJjpFgCC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Installing the sorter and the generalized interface\n","\n","The wrapper software is called \"spikeinterface\" (https://elifesciences.org/articles/61834) and is just one pip away:"],"metadata":{"id":"seq47cgBG3DC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install spikeinterface"],"metadata":{"id":"kRAMnJOKHFbh"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["It comes pre-configured with just a few spike sorters:"],"metadata":{"id":"-GmFe8IKHD_J"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import spikeinterface.sorters as ss\n","ss.installed_sorters()"],"metadata":{"id":"whR0SX4OHNyF"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["but we can easily install several more:"],"metadata":{"id":"GZy1b9IsHiiU"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install herdingspikes\n","!pip install mountainsort5"],"metadata":{"id":"7T-_LwxjISz7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The standard invocation for importing spikeinterface is a little elaborate:"],"metadata":{"id":"X534iG-hHkuk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import spikeinterface as si\n","import spikeinterface.extractors as se\n","import spikeinterface.preprocessing as spre\n","import spikeinterface.sorters as ss\n","import spikeinterface.postprocessing as spost\n","import spikeinterface.qualitymetrics as sqm\n","import spikeinterface.comparison as sc\n","import spikeinterface.exporters as sexp\n","import spikeinterface.widgets as sw\n","from probeinterface import Probe\n","from probeinterface.plotting import plot_probe\n","\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","from pathlib import Path\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tCeavzbnIe9g"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Loading data into spikeinterface\n","\n","Loading raw data into spikeinterface is straightforward, though I had to jump through some hoops to make it load our SALPA-preprocessed data.
