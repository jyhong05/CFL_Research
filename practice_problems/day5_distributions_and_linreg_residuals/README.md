# Single Cell and Hypothesis Testing Day led by Tara Chari

In this workshop we will explore the basics of matrix operations and regression with single-cell data, how to measure gene-gene or cell-cell relationships through correlation and distance metrics, and how to do model selection when representing single-cell gene counts.

The code folder contains notebooks for (1) applying regression models to single cell data (e.g. linear/logistic regression and partial correlation calculations) and (2) fitting the relevant count distributions to single-cell data and assessing the properties of the count data.

The manual_exercise folder contains handwritten exercises for understanding basic properties of expectation and matrix algebra in the context of regression and correlation.
