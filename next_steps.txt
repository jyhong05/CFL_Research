1. cluster # vs accuracy, varying for different sample sizes as well (keep uniform distribution)
- The coarser the data, the more effect number of clusters has (stronger negative relationship)

2. nonlinear function for temp generation, keep same stdev as linear
- Exponential distribution makes clustering more coarser, probably because higher power exponential functions turn it more of a binary classifier than a continuous relationship
    - high alt vs not as high
    - try playing around with nn architercture? I don't know if that will help though, reconstructed elevation reflects nonlinear temp plot pretty well
- try other nonlinear funcs?

3. how to structure neural net based on only cause and effect, don't know ground truth?
- need to play around with different temp generation functions, giving different Y, X stays same

4. change CFL library code to run without venv
- import old library versions within CFL library or update all uses of functions?
    - first option probably a lot easier, sifting through entire repo will not be fun
